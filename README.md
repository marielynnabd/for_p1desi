# for_p1desi

for_p1desi is a small collection of Python data processing utilities designed to support **data split measurements** of the Lyman-alpha forest 1D power spectrum (P1D) 
mainly done using the [p1desi](https://github.com/corentinravoux/p1desi) software.

## Purpose

This repository contains helper functions used to prepare and process data splits for the analysis published in: Ravoux et al. (2025) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09493)

## Features

- Functions to process observational data splits
- Integration with the official p1desi pipeline
- Designed for reproducibility of the published results
